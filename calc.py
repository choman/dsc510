# Abstract: This programming takes in basic company info and lenth of fiber cable. 
#           Calculates the cost of the cable based on length and if discounts apply.
#           Then displays a receipt for the company's purchase.
#
# Create a program with the following requirements:
#
#  * Your program must have a header.
#  * This program will perform various calculations (addition, subtraction,
#    multiplication, division, and average calculation)
#  * This program will contain a variety of loops and functions.
#  * The program will add, subtract, multiply, divide two numbers and provide
#    the average of multiple numbers input by the user.
#  * Define a function named performCalculation which takes one parameter.
#    The parameter will be the operation being performed (+, -, *, /).
#     - This function will perform the given prompt the user for two numbers then
#       perform the expected operation depending on the parameter that's passed
#       into the function.
#     - This function will print the calculated value for the end user.
#  * Define a function named calculateAverage which takes no parameters.
#      - This function will ask the user how many numbers they wish to input.
#      - This function will use the number of times to run the program within a
#        for loop in order to calculate the total and average.
#      - This function will print the calculated average.
#  * This program will have a main section which contains a while loop. The while
#    loop will be used to allow the user to run the program until they enter a
#    value which ends the loop.
#  * The main program should prompt the user for the operation they wish to perform.
#  * The main program should evaluate the entered data using if statements.
#  * The main program should call the necessary function to perform the calculation.
