# Abstract: We will create a program which performs three essential
#           operations. It will process this .txt file: Gettysburg.txt.
#           Calculate the total words, and output the number of
#           occurrences of each word in the file.
#
#           - Open the file and process each line.
#           - Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency
#             of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
#           - Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low
#             frequency. You should use string formatting for this.
#
#           We want to achieve each major goal with a function
#           (one function, one action). We can find four functions
#           that need to be created.
#
#           add_word: Add each word to the dictionary. Parameters are
#           the word and a dictionary. No return value.
#
#           Process_line: There is some work to be done to process
#           the line: strip off various characters, split out the words,
#           and so on. Parameters are a line and the dictionary. It calls
#           the function add word with each processed word. No return value.
#
#           Pretty_print: Because formatted printing can be messy and
#           often particular to each situation (meaning that we might
#           need to modify it later), we separated out the printing
#           function. The parameter is a dictionary. No return value.
#
#           main: We will use a main function as the main program. As
#           usual, it will open the file and call process_line on each
#           line. When finished, it will call pretty_print to print
#           the dictionary.
#
#           In the main function, you will need to open the file. We
#           will cover more regarding opening of files next week but
#           I wanted to provide you with the block of code you will
#           utilize to open the file, see below.
#
# Create a program with the following requirements:
#
#  - Your program must have a header.
